# ðŸŽ² Simple Dice Game in Python

This is a simple command-line **Dice Game** built with Python, where **2 to 4 players** compete by rolling a virtual die. The objective is to be the first to reach **50 points**. Each player takes turns rolling the dice, with a twistâ€”rolling a `1` ends the turn with zero points for that round.

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Rules

- The game supports **2 to 4 players**.
- On their turn, players can choose to:
  - **Roll the die**: Adds a random number (2â€“6) to the current turn score.
  - **Skip the turn**: Score remains unchanged.
- If the player rolls a `1`:
  - The turn ends immediately.
  - The player scores **0 points** for that round.
- The first player to reach **50 points** wins.

## ðŸ§  How the Code Works

- Uses the `random` module to simulate dice rolls.
- Loops through players in rounds until someone reaches 50.
- Validates user input for number of players and roll/skip choices.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3+).
2. Save the code in a file, e.g., `dice_game.py`.
3. Run it using the terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python dice_game.py

Enter the number of players (2 - 4): 2
